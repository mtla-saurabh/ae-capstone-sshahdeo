# Installation

- Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dev requirements ([dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/))
- Run `pre-commit install` to set up your git hook scripts. This will set your hooks so that the next time you push, pre-commit will be invoked (note: on its first invocation, pre-commit will need to install its own dependencies which may take a minute; these dependencies will be installed outside of your project and will be available from that moment onwards).

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pre-commit install
```

# Working with Pre-Commit
- Pre-commit is configured to run various checks automatically when you attempt to push your code. We've overridden the default commit pattern to run on push to make committing small changes easier. When you attempt to push your code the pre-commit hooks will run, and if they pass, the push will succeed; if not there is some sort of issue that needs to be resolved before pushing your changes.
- Pre-commit will only run against changed files to keep its execution as quick as possible.
- On its first execution, pre-commit will install any dependencies it needs into a virtual environment (located outside of this repo); this may take a few minutes on its first run, but every following run will reuse that env and as a result will be much quicker.

# Working with SQLFluff
- SQLFluff lint is configured as a pre-commit hook that runs on push, so in most cases no explicit commands are needed. This will only list errors and will not fix any errors if found.
- If you would like to run SQLFluff lint manually, or would like to run it in fix mode, you can do so with the following commands which will run them through pre-commit. 
```
pre-commit run --hook-stage push sqlfluff-lint --all-files
pre-commit run --hook-stage manual sqlfluff-fix --all-files
```

# Working with YAMLLint
- YAMLLint is configured as a pre-commit, so in most cases no explicit commands are needed. This will only list errors and will not fix any errors if found.
- If you would like to run YAMLLint manually, you can do so with the following command which will run it through pre-commit.
```
pre-commit run --hook-stage push yamllint
```
